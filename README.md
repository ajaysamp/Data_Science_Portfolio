# Springboard Data Science

This repository contains all data, projects, and reports that are part of my 'Data Science Career Track' training at Spring Board.

# Capstone Project 1 - Bottoms-Up

The project analyzes beer ratings from all around the world. The idea is to understand which countries have the most popular beers and the parameters affecting the ratings. The project looks at the beers from the United States to find the states and cities with the best beers.
The project also applies machine learning techniques to predict beer ratings given a set of known parameters.

# Data Wrangling

Projetcs on cleaning up messy data using pandas - XML, JSON, raw text and working with databases

# Inferential Statistics

Understanding inferential statistics for drawing conclusions and predicting outcomes. Contains three miniprojects :

Human Body Temperature - hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance
Examining Racial Discrimination - does race have a significant impact on the rate of callbacks?
Reducing Hospital Readmissions - statistical analysis to reduce readmissions to hospitals.

# Machine Learning

Goal is to understand various machine learning models, their advantages and limitations. Contains the following miniprojects :

Boston House Pricing - predicting housing prices in Boston using linear regression
Heights and Weights - using logistic regression to classify gender
Predicting Movie Ratings - use naive bayes algorithm to accurately predict movie ratings based on their reviews
Customer Segmentation - employ k-means clustering and associated accuracy metrics to partitioning problems
