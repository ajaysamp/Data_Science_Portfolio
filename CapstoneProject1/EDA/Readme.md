# Exploratory Data Analysis

Beer ratings from around the world have been analyzed in the ipython notebook titled "ExploratoryDataAnalysis". The following are some of the questions the analsyis will try to explore.

1. Which countries have the most number of beers?
2. Which countries have the best beers? A beer will be considered 'best' if it has an average rating greater than 3.5.

4. Which states in the US have the best beers?
5. How do beers in the US compare with beers from the rest of the world?
6. What are some of the key parameters that affect the average ratings? ABV? Overall Score?Beer Style?


# Modeling
Machine Learning modeling techniques have been applied and is described in the "Modeling" ipython notebook in this folder. The following have been analyzed:

1. Clustering methods have been applied to predict country labels based on the other variables 
2. Classification techniques have been applied to predict if a beer will have a rating above or below 4
