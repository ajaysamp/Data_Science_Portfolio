## Inferential Statisitics 

The relationship between the different variables were analyzed as part of the Exploratory Data Analysis. The mean, standard deviation and the other statistical parameters were analyzed to explore outliers and get a general idea about the quality of the data. 

Box plots were used to get a general comparison for the statistical parameters such as the mean and maximum values between the numerical variables for different categorical variables such as beer styles and country. The boxplots are useful for getting information on outliers and other useful staisitcs.

Correlation between the numerical variables was analysed using scatter plots and stats model package in python. The scatter plots did not indicate any clear trends between the Average Rating, ABV and Rating Count. There was only a weak positive correlation that was statistically significant based on a hypothesis testing. 

Histograms for the numerical variables were also plotted to understand the distribution of the data.

In general, the statistical analysis provided some insights into the data. However, no clear trends were observed between the variables, which by itself is interesting.
