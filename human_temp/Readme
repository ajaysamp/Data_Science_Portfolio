# What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?**

## Background

The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37 ∘∘ C or 98.6 ∘∘ F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

A dataset of human body temperatures was analyezed and the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance were employed to check the statistical validity of the above mentioned mentioned mean temperature.

##Conclusion

A one sample t-test was perfomed. The p-value from the t-test was observed to be well below 0.05. Hence, the null hypothesis was rejected, which indicates that the mean body temperature is indeed different from 98.6 degree F. Also, a two-sample t-test was done for the male and female temperatures. The results indicate that the mean values for the male and female temperatures are significantly different.
