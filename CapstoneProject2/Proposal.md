This project will primarily focus on obtaining data from diferent API's such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other sources from where data is available. The idea is tp derive insights on usage and other variables and build an end-to-end solution providing results in a dashboard. The dashboard will be built using plotly. The project will also apply NLP and geo spatial analytics for machine learning models. 

**_Who will be interested?_**

This primary goal of this project is to learn getting data from API's and building end-to-end dashboard solutions for insights and modeling analysis. This is something that will help with my current job. 

# Data 

Data will be obtained from publicly available API's from sources such as Twitter, LinkedIn and more. Other sources will be obtained from websites such as Programmable Web. 

# Analysis Methodology

The biggest challenge will be to wrangle data from different sources and combine them to get a final dataset. The idea is to get as many clean datasets as possible so that the focus is on analysis and learning new machine learning techniques.

# Deliverables

The following deliverables will be submitted as part of this project and will be made available in a git hub repository.
* Final Report/Paper
* Dahsboard 
* Presentation
* Codes used for the analysis
