This project will primarily focus on obtaining data from diferent API's such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other sources from where data is available. Insights will be derived on usage of the different social media websites at different areas across the United States and their dependency on different variables such as demography and location. A predcitive model will be built to estimate the usage in areas where data is not available. A clusterting algorithm will be developed to classify areas based on usage and type of buildings that are present (residential, hotel, commerce etc.). NLP techniques will be applied to identify patterns in social media usage. A dashborad will be built to provide and end-to-end solution that can be used by a sales team.

This primary goal of this project is to learn getting data from API's, building end-to-end dashboard solutions, and learning advanced machine learning techniques such as NLP. 

**Business Case:** Telecom companies are always trying to exapnd their markets and services. One of the key paramters for expansion is usage (bandwidth) in a particular area. The usage dictates the type of services the company has to offer such as fiber, ethernet etc. to attract customers. For example, an area with high usage will need a fiber netowrk. Once the company knows the usage information, they can decide whether they need to invest in that particular area to offer services that are attractive to the customers. These decisions will also be based on the number of businesses/customers in an area and competition(other companies) offering the similar services in the area. 

A telecom company is currently pursuing the above approach to expand their market footprint. They want to understand bandwidth consumption in both existing areas where they offer services and the new market where they would like to expand. In existing areas, they can proactively upgrade services in high usgae areas to keep the customers happy and also win other businesses. The new markets can be classified based on the usage and other parameters and the marketing team can focus only on those. This is expected to both increase sales and cut down investment cost for expansion . Offering fiber services is expensive, and the comapny can identify to those markets where they know they have high chance of winning customers and plan efficiently. 

# Data 

Data will be obtained from publicly available API's from sources such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Bing and more. Other sources will be obtained from websites such as Programmable Web. 

# Analysis Methodology

The first phase of the project will focus on obatining and combining the datasets from the different sources. Exploratory data analysis will be performed to get insights on the data. The second phase of the project will involve a prediction (to find high usage areas based on different variables) and a clustering algorithm (classify areas based on usage and other parameters). NLP techiques will be applied during this phase of the work. The final phase of the project will focus on building an end-to-end solution using a dashboard.

The biggest challenge will be to wrangle data from different sources and combine them to get a final dataset. The idea is to get as many clean datasets as possible so that the focus is on analysis and learning new machine learning techniques. 

# Deliverables

The following deliverables will be submitted as part of this project and will be made available in a git hub repository.
* Final Report/Paper
