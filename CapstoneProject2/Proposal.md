This project will primarily focus on obtaining data from diferent API's such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other sources from where data is available. Insights will be derived on usage of the different social media websites at different areas across the United States and their dependency on different variables such as demography and location. A predcitive model will be built to estimate the usage in areas where data is not available. A clusterting algorithm will be developed to classify areas based on usage and type of buildings that are present (residential, hotel, commerce etc.) This will be helpful for a telecom company to proactively market and build services in these areas. NLP techniques will be applied to identify patterns in social media usage. A dashborad will be built to provide and end-to-end solution that can be used by a sales team.

This primary goal of this project is to learn getting data from API's, building end-to-end dashboard solutions, and learning advanced machine learning techniques such as NLP. 

# Data 

Data will be obtained from publicly available API's from sources such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Bing and more. Other sources will be obtained from websites such as Programmable Web. 

# Analysis Methodology

The first phase of the project will focus on obatining and combining the datasets from the different sources. Exploratory data analysis will be performed to get insights on the data. The second phase of the project will involve a prediction (to find high usage areas based on different variables) and a clustering algorithm (classify areas based on usage and other parameters). NLP techiques will be applied during this phase of the work. The final phase of the project will focus on building an end-to-end solution using a dashboard.

The biggest challenge will be to wrangle data from different sources and combine them to get a final dataset. The idea is to get as many clean datasets as possible so that the focus is on analysis and learning new machine learning techniques. 

# Deliverables

The following deliverables will be submitted as part of this project and will be made available in a git hub repository.
* Final Report/Paper
* Dahsboard 
* Presentation
* Codes used for the analysis
