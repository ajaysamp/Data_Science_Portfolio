# Tsunamis

The NOAA/WDS tsunami database is a listing of historical tsunami source events and runup locations throughout the world from 2000 B.C. to the present. The events were gathered from scientific and scholarly sources, regional and worldwide catalogs, tide gauge data, deep ocean sensor data, individual event reports, and unpublished works. There are currently over 2,000 source events in the database with event validities greater than one and over 13,000 runup locations where tsunami effects were observed.

Analyze in which part of the world the most tsunamis have occurred. How have they varied over the years? Which regions have faced the deadliest and worst damages? Is there any reason for a particular region to have the most Tsunamis (if applicable)? Can we predict the location of the next tsunami?
