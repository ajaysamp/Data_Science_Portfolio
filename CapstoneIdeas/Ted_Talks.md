# Description

I am a big fan of Ted Talks. Interestingly, I first came across the topic of data science in a Ted Talk. It will be really cool to analyze the Ted Talks to answer the questions below:

1. Which are the most viewed and most favorited Talks of all time? Why are they popular? 
2. What kind of topics attract the maximum discussion and debate (in the form of comments)? 
3. Which months are most popular among TED and TEDx chapters? 
4. Which themes are most popular amongst TEDsters?
5. Perform a sentiment analysis?
6. Build a recommendation engine for Ted Talks?
7.Estimate number of views from theme and other parameters etc?
