#Problem Statement

Analyze ratings for beers around the world and answer the key questions as below :
Test if the ratings are dependent on the calories, alcohol content, beer type and location.
Analyze to see if beers from countries are rated high by people from the same country.
Which foreign beers are the most popular in the US? And how do they vary by states?
Based on the data which combination of alcohol content and calories will give the best worlwide ratings.

#Who will be interested?
Beer connoisseurs will be interested just out of curiosity. Local restaurants in the US and stock beers accordingly, which may help expand customer base. Local craft breweries in the US can make decisions on calorie count and alcohol content from the analysis.

#Data Sources
Data is available from the following source - https://www.ratebeer.com/tag/showall/
The website contains beers from around the world (a lot of data!). Each beer has location, overall rating, style rating, brewery, and individual ratings from people around the world. Each rating from an individual has location details. Some beers have upto 350 customer ratings and feedback.
The data can be obtained by using their APIâ€™s and in a JSON format. They allow a total of 5,000 requests a month. It will be good to let them know in advance that I will be scraping their website. They have helped students in the past for similar purposes.
